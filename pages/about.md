# **About Me**

Hi! My name's **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm a graduate student in the UC Berkeley Chemistry PhD program with the goal of becoming a leader in industry to develop next generation biological therapeutics for mankind. I enjoy working on interdisciplinary projects that bridge knowledge from various fields, including cell biology, chemical biology, pharmacology, and artificial intelligence. I like to spend my free time writing poetry, playing games, listening to music, working on posts for my professional and personal blogs, and learning about artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning (mach. learn.).
